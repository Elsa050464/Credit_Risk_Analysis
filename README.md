# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction Risk Analysis
The purpose of this project is to build Machine Learning models to help us evaluate Credit Risk We primarily focused on Supervised Learning using the dataset from Lending Club labeled outcome. We used different Machine Learning algorithm sampling techniques such as Oversampling, Undersampling, Combination sampling and Ensemble Learners

## Applications
- Sklearn Metrics
- Imblearn Metrics
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Pathlib
- Collections

## Summary
In business there will always be an underlying risks. For as long as the benefits which in this case is the income generated -outweighs the risks - payment defaults. Credit risk analysis through Machine Learning models helped us quantify and draw conclusions where good loans still outnumbered risky loans. In review the six models, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier yielded the best results in all categories. The precision in all models were consistent. Machine Learning will aid decision makers and can focus to the High Risk individual to see if it's worth extending loans to them. This will help them save time as the machine can help in automatically approving less riskier loans.
